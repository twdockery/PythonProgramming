# PythonProgramming
 
# I'm trying to learn the basics of python programming. In here you'll see some exercises, some mistakes, and false starts. I hope to keep it interesting. Don't expect too much and you won't be let down too far.

# I'll be using a few different items to do this. I have pycharm and anaconda with jupyter notebook at the moment.
