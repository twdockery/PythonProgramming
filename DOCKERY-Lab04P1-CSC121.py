"""
Diabetes is diagnosed by measuring patientâ€™s fasting plasma glucose level (FPG).  If FPG is higher than 125, the patient has diabetes.  If FPG is higher than 100 but not higher than 125, the patient has pre-diabetes.  FPG 100 or lower is considered as a healthy level.  Write a program to do diabetes diagnosis for multiple patients.  For each patient, enter FPG and determine whether the patient has diabetes, pre-diabetes or a healthy FPG level.  Ask the user to answer a yes/no question to indicate whether he/she wants to do diagnosis for another patient.
