Create a module currency, which includes the following three functions that do currency conversions:

to_euro(dollar): This function receives US Dollar as an argument and converts it to Euro.  1 US Dollar = 0.81 Euro.  Return Euro.
to_yen(dollar): This function receives US Dollar as an argument and converts it to Japanese Yen.  1 US Dollar = 106.45 Yen.  Return Yen.
to_peso(dollar): This function receives US Dollar as an argument and converts it to Mexican Peso.  1 US Dollar = 18.58 Peso.  Return Peso.
Store these three functions in a file named currency.py.

Create a file for the main module.  Name the file lab08P3.py.

Define a main function in the main module to do the following:
• Ask the user to choose a foreign currency: Euro, Japanese Yen or Mexican Peso.
Write a loop to validate user input. If an invalid choice is made, display an error message and
ask the user to choose a foreign currency again until the choice is valid.
• Ask the user to enter US dollar amount. Write a loop to validate user input.
If the US dollar amount is negative, display an error message and ask the user to reenter it until it is non-negative.
• Call one of the three functions in the currency module to convert US dollar to the foreign currency chosen by the user
• Receive and display the converted foreign currency

  The following is an example.
